<!-- We are an interdisciplinary group, with interests in genomics, statistical machine learning, algorithms, T cell biology and tumor immunology. -->


<!-- We have recently moved to the <a href = "https://www.weizmann.ac.il/immunology/">Weizmann Institute</a> from the Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science at <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. Our lab takes a data- centric perspective on studying how changes in transcription are associated with cellular phenotypes in immunity and cancer. To achieve that, we are developing and applying computational tools to design and make sense of large molecular data sets. We have special interest in single cell genomics, with the goal of delineating and better understanding the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nbt.3711">factors</a> that contribute to variability between cells (e.g, 
<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.05.045"> metabolic activity</a>, 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2022.100182"> chromatin structure</a>, 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-022-01272-8">microenvironment</a>) 
and their broader implications 
in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-14118-w">autoimmunity</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.015">cancer</a>. -->

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
